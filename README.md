This is a StramCo job Challenge. 

Motivation - Practice with real jobs applications

The Challenge
It's pretty simple. Using the provided screens as a reference, you'll need to build a set of React components to render the app. You'll also need to request a JSON feed, filter that data, and use the relevant fields.
Although this is a basic exercise, we'll be looking for simple, well-designed, performant, and tested code in the submission.

How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
To solve this, i used React and it dependencies. I broke the project in Pages and Components, each with own styles.
To the routes, i just used React Router.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
 - I Would change the interface styles.
 - Make a better logic in Header Component.
